(I understand you are looking for an advanced replacement for your SMART Unifi® (XX) projector. I am happy to help.)


Thank you for completing all relevant troubleshooting steps. As the issue hasn’t resolved, we’re happy to replace your Unifi® projector under warranty.

 

I have processed the RMA (Return Manufacturer Authorization) for a SMART Unifi® (XX) projector for incident (XXXXXXX), and the replacement will be shipped to you shortly.

 

As the RMA process proceeds, we will send out an email to (you_/your customer) at (______@_____) which details our Advanced Replacement Terms and Conditions. Once this is accepted, a replacement projector will ship within 24 hours, and should arrive within 3-5 business days. Please watch for this email, as it should arrive within the hour. Please let us know as soon as possible if it doesn't arrive as the projector(s) will not ship until we've logged your acceptance.

Once you have received your replacement projector, you can return the defective projector. The shipping labels and return details will be with the replacement projector packaging, and you can use this box to send the defective projector back to SMART.

 

If you have any further questions or concerns, please contact us again.
