(I understand you are having connection issues with your M600 SMART Board® interactive whiteboard. I am happy to help.)

The Select button's light also indicates the status of the interactive whiteboard. The Select button's light is solid white when the system is working properly.

The following shows the Select button's normal states. If the light's behavior doesn't match a state listed here, please let us know.

Select light state: Flashing white
Meaning: Your interactive whiteboard is receiving power and is communicating successfully with your computer's USB HID driver but SMART Product Drivers isn't installed.

N O T E
In HID mode, interactive whiteboard tools such as the pens are unavailable, but you can move the mouse pointer and perform mouse functions by touching the interactive surface.
The Right-Click button on the pen tray might work, depending on the version of operating system you’re using. Neither the Keyboard nor the Orient button works in HID mode.

Solution: Start SMART Board service. To determine whether the SMART Board service is running, open SMART Settings and check the message that appears at the bottom. If you do not have SMART Product Drivers installed then install the latest SMART Product Drivers on your computer from the link below.

If you have a SMART Unifi® projector attached the SMART Board interactive whiteboard, please check the USB port mapping in the Unifi projector menu.

Push menu on your projector’s remote. Scroll to the right to the third icon. You should see USB 1 and USB 2 Source at the bottom, and they should be set to VGA 1 and 2 or match your current configuration.

Select light state: Solid white
Meaning: Your interactive whiteboard is receiving power and is communicating successfully with SMART Product Drivers. When you press another pen tray button, the Select button's light turns off and the light on the button you pressed turns on.

A solid white status light indicates that the interactive whiteboard is working properly. However, if the pen tray tools don’t work as expected, try the following to resolve the issue.
If another user reassigned the pen, eraser or other button functions, the tools might not work as expected. You can return them to normal operation using SMART Settings to change the SMART hardware settings.

-Reset the interactive whiteboard by disconnecting the power cable at the wall outlet, and connecting it again.
-Calibrate the cameras to ensure that they accurately track your fingers and the pens.

To calibrate your interactive whiteboard
1. The first time you connect your interactive whiteboard, press the "Please calibrate the SMART Board interactive whiteboard" pop-up bubble that appears in the bottom right corner of your screen.
If the pop-up doesn't appear, click the SMART software icon in the Windows notification area or Mac Dock and select SMART Settings > SMART Hardware Settings > Advanced >Calibrate
The calibration window opens.
2. With a pen tray pen, press the first target.
3. Keeping the pen on the interactive whiteboard surface, draw along the track until you reach the second target. Keep the pen in the track, regardless of where the digital ink appears.
4. When you reach the second target, lift the pen from the surface.
5. If the calibration window remains open, the cameras require further calibration. Trace your pen around the track a second or even a third time until the calibration window closes.
The orientation screen appears.

Select light state: Solid amber
Meaning: The controller module is in service mode or the firmware is being updated.
Solution: Wait for the firmware update to finish.

Select light state: Off 
Meaning: You have selected a non-standard digital ink color using SMART Notebook software or SMART Ink, your interactive whiteboard isn't receiving power or your interactive whiteboard is in Standby mode.
Solution: Reset your interactive whiteboard by disconnecting and then reconnecting the power cable at the wall outlet. Check that the USB cable is connected securely.Touch the interactive whiteboard surface to wake up your computer or turn your computer on. Press a pen tray button to select a standard color or tool.
