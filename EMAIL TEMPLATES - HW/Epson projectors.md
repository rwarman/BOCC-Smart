(I understand that you are experiencing difficulties with an Epson projector that was installed with your SMART Board® interactive whiteboard. I am happy to help.)

 

The SMART Board interactive whiteboard can be broken up into two key components: the whiteboard and the projector. We will be happy to assist you with any troubles you may be having with the SMART Board interactive whiteboard. If the issue is with the projector itself, please contact Epson in order to discover how to properly resolve your issue.
