(I understand you have a faulty cross-member on your Mobile floor stand. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. I am happy to help.)

SMART has identified a potential issue with floor stands built in December 2011. We recommend that the cross members on any unit with a date code of 201149, 201150, 201151, or 201152 be replaced. 

The date codes are located on the packaging of the FS-SB as well as on a sticker fixed on the cross-member.

If your product falls under any of these date stamps, feel free to reply to this email with your serial number.
