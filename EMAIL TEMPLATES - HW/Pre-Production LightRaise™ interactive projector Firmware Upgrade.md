(I understand you have a pre-production LightRaise™ interactive projector 60wi that requires a firmware upgrade. I can certainly assist you with that.)

To upgrade the firmware on your LightRaise 60wi projector

Go to http://smarttech.com/Support/Browse+Support/Download+Software+Internal/Hardware/Interactive+projectors/Lightraise+60wi+firmware and download the 0068-1.1.2.0-app.bin file.

If you have a Windows operating system:

Depending on your operating system, save the file to C:\Program Files (x86)\SMART Technologies\Education Software\Firmware\SP2 or to C:\Program Files\SMART Technologies\Education Software\Firmware\SP2.

If you have Mac operating system software:

Go to HD\Applications\SMART Technologies\SMART Tools

Control-click the Firmware Updater app and select Get Info.

Expand the Sharing & Permissions section.

Click the lock icon in the bottom right to authorize changes to this bundle, set the admin and everyone permissions to Read and Write, click the lock again to secure the changes and then close the window.

Control-click the Firmware Updater app and select Show package contents.

Drag the 0068-1.1.2.0-app.bin firmware file into this window.

NOTE 

You need to save this file on one computer only, not on each computer you connect to the projector.

The Firmware file you downloaded has a file name of "0068_1_1_2_0.app". The correct format has hyphens instead of underscores  and ".bin" at the end. Please rename it to "0068-1-1-2-0-app.bin" (without the quotation marks) as this is the correct format.

Ensure the computer is connected to the projector with a USB connection.

Turn on the projector.

Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\SMART Technologies\Education Software\ (Windows) or HD\Applications\SMART Technologies\SMART Tools (Mac) and run the SMARTFirmwareUpdater.exe file.

The SMART Firmware Upgrade wizard appears.

Click Next.

Select the LightRaise 60wi model that has 1.1.2.0 in the Available Version column and Application in the Firmware Type column.

Click Next.

The Touch Detection Module (TDM) status light turns amber and might flash.

Wait for the progress bar to complete and for the “Firmware Download Complete” message to appear. This can take a few minutes.

The projector restarts and the TDM status light turns green.

To complete the projector set up

Click the SMART Board icon in the Windows notification area or Mac Menu bar, and then select SMART Settings.

The SMART Settings window appears.

Select Connection Wizard.

The SMART Connection Wizard window appears.

Select LightRaise 60wi interactive projector from the SMART Products found drop-down list, click Next, and then select Product is being set up for the first time.

Follow the on-screen instructions to orient and align the projector.
