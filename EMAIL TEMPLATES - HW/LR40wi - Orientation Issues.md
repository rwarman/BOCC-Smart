(I understand you have a customer with an orientation issue on their SMART LightRaise™ 40wi interactive projector. I would be happy to assist you with that.)

Please ensure that you are using the native resolution for this unit, and it matches the aspect ratio set in the projector's menu.

For 16:10 you can use 1280x800, and for 16:9 you can use 1280x800. If the computer is already set this way, please change it to something else, and then change it back.

We will also want to ensure we are running SMART Product Drivers 11.0 or higher.

Is this issue just on one computer, or is it happening on several?
