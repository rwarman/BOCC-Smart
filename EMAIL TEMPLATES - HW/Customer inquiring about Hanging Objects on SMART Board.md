There are two things we will need to consider whether it is OK to hang tobjects on the SMART Board® interactive whiteboards interactive surface.


The first is, are the objects coming into contact with the interactive surface. If this is occuring then it can cause a constant point of contact causing the mouse to behave erratically as it causes the SMART Board to think someone is touching that point where the object makes contact with the interactive surface. I have included a constant contact document for you below.

The second thing to take into account is whether these objects are shielded or not. If the object has any exposed metallic components and that comes into contact with the SMART Board, it can cause grounding issues, where you will notice when they try to interact with the board using the pen, the lines appear jagged.


I have included a document below which explains jagged lines problems on the SMART Board for your review.
