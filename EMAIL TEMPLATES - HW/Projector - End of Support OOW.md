Below are several resources that you can use to obtain support for products that are outside of warranty.


SMART’s online Support Center contains many useful documents such as user’s guides, installation guides, and troubleshooting documents - www.smarttech.com/support

Sometimes purchasing a new projector with a new warranty can be more economical than repairing an old projector. Please contact your reseller for details.
