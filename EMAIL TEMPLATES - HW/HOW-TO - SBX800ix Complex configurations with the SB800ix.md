Complex configurations with the SB800ix/SB800i5 system and the WC8/XT accessories

 

Assumption before reading this document: This is how the system is supposed to work using the default USB/Input configuration on the projectors. New UX60 projectors and the UF75 projectors allow mapping the USB ports on the ECP to the VGA or HDMI inputs of the projector allowing different configurations. The assumption here is the default:

USB1 is mapped to VGA1, USB2 is mapped to VGA2.

 

This is the standard SB885ix configuration

Dedicated computer:

 Uses the USB1 (Desktop Icon) connection on the ECP to control the SMART

Board

 Uses the USB1 (Desktop Icon) connection on the ECP and to output sound to the SB800 master. The master outputs sound to the projector and the projector to the speaker.

 Uses the VGA1 input to project an image on the SMART Board interactive whiteboard.

 Uses the USB-A key on the ECP.

Note: The USB-A port on the ECP only works with the USB1 port at the back of the ECP.

 

Guest Laptop:

 Uses the USB2 (Laptop Icon) connection to control the SMART Board interactive whiteboard. Uses the USB2 (Laptop Icon) connection to output sound to the SB800 master. The master outputs sound to the projector and the projector to the speaker.

 Uses the VGA2 input to project an image on the SMART Board interactive whiteboard.

 It can뭪 use the USB-A key on the ECP

 

Complex configuration 1

Dedicated computer:

 Uses the USB1 (Desktop Icon) connection on the ECP to control the SMART

Board

 Uses the USB1 (Desktop Icon) connection on the ECP to output sound to the SB800 master. The master outputs sound to the projector and the projector to the speaker.

 Uses the VGA1 input to project an image on the SMART Board interactive whiteboard..

 Uses the USB-A key on the ECP.

 

Guest Laptop:

 Uses the SB800 CAT5-XT or WC8 accessories to control the SMART Board interactive whiteboard..

 Uses the SB800 CAT5-XT or WC8 accessories to output sound to the SB800 master. The master outputs sound to the projector and the projector to the speaker.

 Uses the VGA2 input to project an image on the SMART Board interactive whiteboard..

 It can뭪 use the USB-A key on the ECP

 

Important note: The USB2 at the back of the ECP can뭪 be used. If used, it will override the accessory connection to the guest laptop.

 

Complex configuration 2

Dedicated computer:

 Uses the USB1 (Desktop Icon) connection on the ECP to control the SMART

Board

 Uses the USB1 (Desktop Icon) connection on the ECP to output sound to the SB800 master.

 Uses the VGA1 input to project an image on the SMART Board interactive whiteboard..

 Uses the USB-A key on the ECP.

 

Guest Laptop:

 Uses the SB800 CAT5-XT or WC8 accessories to control the SMART Board interactive whiteboard..

 Uses the HMDI cable to output sound to the projector and the projector to the speaker.

 Uses the HDMI input to project an image on the SMART Board interactive whiteboard..

 It can뭪 use the USB-A key on the ECP

 

Important note: Since the sound now will be outputted through HDMI, the installer

would need to configure the computer to set HDMI as the default output on the

guest computer.

 

Complex configuration 3

Dedicated computer:

 Uses the USB1 (Desktop Icon) connection on the ECP to control the SMART

Board

 It can뭪 use the USB-A key on the ECP

 

Guest Laptop #2 (PC3):

 Uses the SB800 CAT5-XT or WC8 accessories to control the SMART Board interactive whiteboard..

 Uses the HMDI cable to output sound to the projector and the projector to the speaker.

 Uses the HDMI input to project an image on the SMART Board interactive whiteboard..

 It can뭪 use the USB-A key on the ECP
