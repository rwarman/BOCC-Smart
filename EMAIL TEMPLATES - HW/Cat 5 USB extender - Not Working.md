Thank you for contacting SMART Technologies.


(I understand that you have a Cat 5 USB extender that is no longer working. I am happy to help.)


If you have the Cat 5 USB extender for the SB600 series SMART Board® interactive whiteboard, these units were not serialized. I will need to know if this Cat 5 USB extender was purchased at the same time as the SMART Board® interactive whiteboard or was it purchased separately.


If it was purchased at the same time as the SMART Board® interactive whiteboard then please provide the serial number of the SMART Board interactive whiteboard. I have included a link below on where to locate this.

If the Cat 5 USB extender was purchased separately from the SMART Board interactive whiteboard then please provide the purchase order number so we can verify its warranty.


(If you have any further questions or concerns, please contact us again.)
