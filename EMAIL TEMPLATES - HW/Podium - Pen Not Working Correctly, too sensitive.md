(I understand that the pen on your SMART Podium™ interactive pen display is too sensitive and not interacting properly. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. I am happy to help.

 

To troubleshoot this issue, please try disabling the Hover feature on your SMART Podium display.

 

To disable the Hover feature

 

1. Click on the Board Tools (SMART Board) icon in your computer’s notification area, and then select “SMART Settings”.

 

The SMART Settings should appear.

 

2. Select “SMART Hardware Settings”

 

3. If using more than one SMART product, select your SMART Podium display from the “Select a SMART product” area.

 

4. Select “Mouse Settings” from the dropdown list.

 

5. Clear the “Enable Hover” check box, and then press OK.

 

6. Close the “SMART Settings” (or SMART Control Panel) window.

 

 

If your tethered pen is still too sensitive, and it interacts with your SMART Podium display before you press the display surface, or if it doesn't work at all, then please swap the pen with a known-working one and let me know the outcome.

 

(For further reference your support incident number is (XXXXXXX)).

 

If you have any further questions or concerns, please contact us again.
