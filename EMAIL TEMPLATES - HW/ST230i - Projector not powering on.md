(I understand your SMART Table® interactive learning center is not displaying an image when you press the power button. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. I am happy to help.)

 

If your SMART Table’s power button illuminates blue when pressed, but doesn’t display an image, then the Unifi® 55 projector installed in your SMART Table may not be powering on properly.

 

To access and troubleshoot the Unifi projector, please open your SMART Table’s side cabinet doors.

 

Locate the Unifi projector’s remote control. Does the Unifi projector power on while using the remote control? If the projector does not power on please verify that the plastic has been removed from the remote control’s battery compartment. The remote control also requires a direct line of sight to the underside of the Unifi projector, so please place the remote control underneath and angle it upwards, where the Unifi projector’s status lights are located, and press the power button.

 

If your Unifi projector does not power on properly, please locate the two status lights on the underside of your Unifi projector. Please check what colors they display (both the power light and wrench light). If the power light is flashing green, wait for approximately a minute and see if the status lights change. Please provide us with the status lights on the Unifi projector, as well as the serial number written on the Unifi projector (resembling B012EF1234567).

 

If the Unifi projector does power on properly and displays an image, then we can resolve your issue by changing your SMART Table’s hardware configuration. You can adjust the hardware configuration by following the steps below.

 

Connect your USB bracelet (or USB device) to your SMART Table to enter Teacher mode. From within Teacher mode, press the “X’ to enter Desktop mode and say “yes” when prompted.

 

Once Desktop mode launches, select:

 

Start > Computer > C:\ > Program Files > SMART Technologies > SMART Table > Table Service > HardwareConfigurationGUI.

 

Open the “HardwareConfigurationGui” and check your projector’s setting. It should be set to “Cosmo”. If it reads “Casio”, change it to “Cosmo” then click: File > Save As

When prompted for a file save location, save the file as “config.xml” in the following location:

 

C:\Program Files\SMART Technologies\SMART Table\Table Service\config.xml.

 

Choose “Yes” when prompted if you want to overwrite any existing file. Close the window then restart your SMART Table’s computer (Start > Restart). Your SMART Table will restart into SMART Table software (Student mode).

 

Power off the SMART Table using the power button on its side. The Unifi projector should also power off properly. To check if the hardware configuration changes took effect, you’ll want to power on the SMART Table again using the power button. The Unifi projector should now power on properly with the SMART Table. If not, try powering cycling your SMART Table once more.

 

Are you using a SMART authorized lamp in this unit, or is it third party? SMART authorized lamps have OSRAM stamped on the back of the lamp housing.


Please let us know if your issue persists, as well as the status lights that appear on the projector. This will help us identify the root cause of the issue.
