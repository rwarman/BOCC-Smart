(I understand that you have eInstruction software installed on your computer and you have a flashing green light on your SMART Board® interactive whiteboard.  I am happy to help.)

 

There is a known conflict between eInstruction software and SMART Software.  Please use one of the following workarounds to use your SMART Board interactive whiteboard while having eInstruction software installed on your computer.

 

Workaround #1

1. Close the eInstruction Device Manager

2. Open SMART Settings:
In Windows XP/Vista/7 go to Start > All Programs > SMART Technologies > SMART Tools > SMART Settings. In Windows 8 press the Windows Key + Q on your keyboard and Type “SMART Settings”(without quotes) in the search box. Click on the SMART Settings application that appears in the results

3. In SMART Settings go to: About Software and Product Support > Tools > Diagnostics

4. In the Diagnostics window click on: Service > Stop, and then: Service > Start

5. Verify your SMART Board interactive whiteboard’s status light. It should reconnect.

6. Now you may launch the eInstruction Device Manager

 

Workaround #2

1. Close the eInstruction Device Manager

2. Open the SMART Settings:

In Windows XP/Vista/7 go to Start > All Programs > SMART Technologies > SMART Tools > SMART Settings. In Windows 8 press the Windows Key + Q on your keyboard and Type “SMART Settings”(without quotes) in the search box. Click on the SMART Settings application that appears in the results

3. Run the Connection Wizard and follow the instructions

4. Verify your SMART Board interactive whiteboard’s status light. It should reconnect.

5. Now you may launch the eInstruction Device Manager

 

Note: Should the SMART Board interactive whiteboard’s USB cable get disconnected while both programs are running, you will need to repeat one of the workarounds above.

 

If your are manually launching both applications, please start the SMART Board Tools first, and then the eInstruction Device Manager.
