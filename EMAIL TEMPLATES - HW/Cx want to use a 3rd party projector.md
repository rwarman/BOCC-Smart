(I understand you are looking to set up a 3rd party projector with your SMART Board® interactive whiteboard and are wondering what would be the best way to do this. I am happy to help.)
 
There would be no special recommendations of set up instructions when installing a 3rd party projector. It would depend on the type of projector, i.e. ceiling mounted, wall mounted, tabletop and would need to be set up according to the manufacturer specifications.
 
It would be no different then having a non-interactive dry erase board on the wall that you are trying to project an image onto or a specific area on a wall you would want to have the image projected onto. You would just have to adjust it so it fits.
 
Wall mounted (above the SMART Board interactive whiteboard) are usually the best option in order to reduce shadows but any will work as long is it is compatible with your computer and able to produce an image large enough to fit the SMART Board interactive whiteboard.

SMART Unifi® projectors are recommended as they were designed to be used with your SMART Board interactive whiteboard. To look into purchasing a Unifi projector please contact your nearest SMART Authorized Reseller.
