(I understand there is an issue with the pen on your LightRaise™ 40wi interactive projector. I would be happy to assist you with this.)

Could I get a description of the status lights on the pen?

Can you confirm that the projector is displaying an active video signal, and is not on the blue logo screen?

In the projector menu, the third option from the left. Is "interactive" set to ON?

In the same screen is the screen functionality set to Whiteboard or Presenter mode?

Has the pen been left to charge for at least 8 hours?

Is the image on the LightRaise projector the primary display?
