2. Confirm the controller has the latest firmware

Connect a USB A-B cable directly from the PC to the SC9/SC12 controller, ensuring there are no extenders used.

If you are using a SMART Board® 800 series interactive whiteboard please connect a USB A-B cable directly from your computer to the USB-B port on the bottom of your pen tray. To do this look under your pen tray; you will see a cable running from the left side of the tray plugging into a port on the right side. Unplug the cable from the right port, and then connect another USB cable from your computer to this port.
 
Run the Firmware Updater (please ensure you have administrative rights on your computer):
 
For Windows:
a) Go to: Start > My Computer > Local Disc (C:) >  Program Files or Program Files (x86) > SMART Technologies > Education software > SMARTFirmwareUpdater.exe
b) Select SMART Board Interactive Whiteboard (SC9/SC9D/SC12) if you have a 600 series or (SC14/SC15) if you have an 800 series, then select ‘next’
c) Proceed with upgrading the firmware to our latest firmware version.
d) Once finished please re-orient the SMART Board interactive whiteboard.
 
For Mac OS: 
a) Go to: Macintosh HD > Applications > SMART Technologies > SMART Tools > Firmware Updater
b) Select SMART Board Interactive Whiteboard (SC9/SC9D/SC12) if you have a 600 series or (SC14/SC15) if you have a 800 series, select Next
c) Proceed with upgrading the firmware to our latest firmware version.
d) Once finished please re-orient the SMART Board interactive whiteboard. 

3. Use a direct USB cable no longer than 16ft (bypass any extenders and/or ECP)

4. Swap the computer, preferably with a computer that works on another interactive whiteboard.

If the issue is not resolved by performing the steps above, obtain the following information:

Confirm pen and finger interactions work correctly?

Serial number(s) of affected units?

Installation date(s)?

Videos(s) depicting the issue (if possible)?

Computer specifications?

Here is the temporary workaround that you can use:

1. Use the tip of the pen tray eraser instead of the entire surface.

2. Use your finger or pen to erase after selecting the eraser tool within Notebook or on the floating toolbar.
