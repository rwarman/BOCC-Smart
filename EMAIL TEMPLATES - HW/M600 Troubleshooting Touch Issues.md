(I understand your M600 SMART Board® interactive whiteboard is unresponsive in some areas. I am happy to help.)

The first thing we want to do is to calibrate the cameras to ensure that they accurately track your fingers and the pens.

To calibrate your interactive whiteboard

1. The first time you connect your interactive whiteboard, press the "Please calibrate the SMART Board interactive whiteboard" pop-up bubble that appears in the bottom right corner of your screen.

If the pop-up doesn't appear, click the SMART software icon in the Windows notification area or Mac Dock and select SMART Settings > SMART Hardware Settings > Advanced >Calibrate

The calibration window opens.

2. With a pen tray pen, press the first target.

3. Keeping the pen on the interactive whiteboard surface, draw along the track until you reach the second target. Keep the pen in the track, regardless of where the digital ink appears.

4. When you reach the second target, lift the pen from the surface.

5. If the calibration window remains open, the cameras require further calibration. Trace your pen around the track a second or even a third time until the calibration window closes.

The orientation screen appears.

6. Pick up a pen from the pen tray.

7. Beginning at the first target on the screen, touch the center of the target firmly with the tip of the pen and hold the pen steady until the target turns green. When you lift the pen the target moves to the next point.

8. Repeat step 3 on all the targets.

9. The Orientation screen closes.

Test to see if that resolves the issue.

If not the navigate to the troubleshooting utility from the diagnostic SBM600 menu.

Start by opening the Diagnostic window from SMART Settings:

 

Windows:

Start > Programs (or All Programs) > SMART Technologies > SMART Tools >SMART Settings > About Software and Product Support > Tools >Diagnostics

                          

Windows 8:

Press “Windows Key” then “q” on your keyboard > Search for “SMART Settings” > select SMART Settings > About Software and Product Support > Tools >Diagnostics

 

Mac OS:

Finder > Applications > SMART Technologies > SMART Settings > About Software and Product Support > Tools > Diagnostics


From within Diagnostics, select “View” from the menu options then select “SBM600 bar”. Once this is selected, select the “troubleshooting utility” button to open the Camera Views. 


Check the real time camera activity waveform for any cameras missing to produce a graph. If all the cameras produce a graph please let us know.


In the troubleshooting utility window on the bottom right, click "Save NWZ" file.


Please save the file to a convenient location on your computer like the Desktop, and attach it to your email response. 


If one camera does not produce a graph then identify the camera position and check the FCC connection to the camera and make sure there is no damage to the ends of the conductors. This is the white ribbon cable underneath at the back of the SMART Board® interactive whiteboard.


You can attempt to re-seat the FCC connection by unplugging and re-plugging the camera cable. Test again to see if that resolves the issue. 


If the issue is not resolved then please wipe the front of the camera with a microfiber cloth only and test again.


(If you have any further questions or concerns, please contact us again.)
