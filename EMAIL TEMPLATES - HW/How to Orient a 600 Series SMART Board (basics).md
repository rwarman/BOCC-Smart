Email template:

(I understand that you have recently acquired a SMART Board® interactive whiteboard, would like to know how to perform an orientation (correct its alignment). I am happy to help.)
 
We have an orientation feature on our products that is used to align touch and pens properly on SMART Board interactive whiteboards.
 
You can bring up the orientation screen by holding down the keyboard and right click button at the same time (located on your pen tray). You may need administrative rights for this function to work.
 
You can also perform an orientation by right clicking on your Board Tools icon, and choosing “orientation”.
 
For more information about orientation, please follow this document:

Note that the “Control Panel” has been renamed to “SMART Settings” in the latest releases of our software.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please contact us again.
