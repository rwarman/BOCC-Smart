(I understand your projector’s lamp has failed, and that replacing the lamp resolves the issue. I am happy to help you, but I require more information to do so.) 

 

Please send us your projector’s serial number, which is located on the top of the projector, beginning with B012. On newer models, it's also located in the projector's on-screen menu (press menu on your projector's remote control). 

 

For current model projectors, lamp warranties last a year, or 1000 hours on the lamp (whichever comes first). Warranties for the Unifi® 35 projector lamps run for 500 hours or 90 days. The projectors themselves carry a three-year warranty.

 

Even though the original lamps in the Unifi 35 projector, Unifi 45 projector and Unifi® 55 projector may no longer be covered under warranty, the situation changes if a new lamp was purchased in the last year. In that case, that warranty may be still valid. To determine this, we would require your reseller’s Purchase Order number, and the lamp hours currently on this projector, if possible.

 

You can locate your lamp hours within your projector’s on-screen menu, accessed with your remote control.

 

Original lamps in newer projectors — namely, the UX60 projector, Unifi® 65 projector, Unifi® 75 projector, LightRaise® 40wi projector and LightRaise® 60wi projector — may be under warranty. The serial number will allow us to confirm this.

 

If your projector is more than a year old, or the lamp life warranty has been exceeded, you can easily order a replacement lamp from the SMART Parts store (https://www.gilmore.ca/smartparts/) or from your current reseller. Let us know the model or serial number of your projector, and we can provide you with the exact part number of a replacement lamp.


Are you using a SMART authorized lamp in this unit, or is it third party? SMART authorized lamps have OSRAM stamped on the back of the lamp housing.

 

If you have any further questions or concerns, please contact us again.
