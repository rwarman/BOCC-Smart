(I understand you are wondering if SMART Board® 500 series interactive whiteboards will work with Windows 7/ Windows 8/ Mac OSX 10.7/10.8 computers.  I am happy to help.)

 

The SMART Board 500 series interactive whiteboard is a discontinued product, and is no longer fully supported by modern operating systems. This includes 64-bit operating systems, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Mac OS 10.9, Mac OS 10.8 and Mac OS 10.7.

 

We are unable to provide full email and phone troubleshooting support for discontinued products, but we can offer you a few suggestions, and direct you to our online resources.

 

We can provide you with a driver for the USB-FRU cable (USB to Serial) which can sometimes help connect SMART Board 500 series interactive whiteboards to newer computers or operating systems.
