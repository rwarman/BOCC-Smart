(I understand your SMART Height Adjustable Wall Mount does not respond or it does not move up or down. I am happy to help.)

 

Please verify that the SMART Height-Adjustable Wall Mount power supply is plugged in to a known working power outlet. Is the issue resolved?


Verify the correct power supply is being used. Ensure the voltage selection switch on the SMART Height-Adjustable Wall Mount is set according to the voltage of your country (115V or 230V AC). Ensure the main power switch is in the ON position.


One of the fuses might have blown. It is located underneath the main power plug-in. Only the first 1400 units had the power switch therefore if you do not see one then please ignore this step. The new SMART Height-Adjustable Wall Mount we currently ship does not have an ON/OFF Switch and is operated by the included remote control.


(If your issue persists, please send us the results of the above steps. This will allow us to identify the root cause of your issue.

For further reference your support incident number is XXXXXXX.
