Issue: Response VE - Answers for True/False and Yes/No questions always show up in English regardless of the language they were created in.
Status: Resolved in Response 4.6.
Workaround: None

Issue: Unable to generate reports with all tags used in ad-hoc quizzes. Only tags from the last question of each assessment included are available.
Status: Resolved in Response 4.6 (ETA early June)
Workaround: Have customers use whole class mode. Set Assessment Delivery option to "The currently Displayed Question Only" on the Response tab. There is no workaround to recover the tagged info for assessments that have already been completed.

Issue: Response PE/XE/VE - Text answers with spaces before or after the text may be marked incorrectly.
Status: Resolved in Response 4.6.
Workaround: None

Issue: "SMART Response VE is unable to create the assessment" error. Preparing assessment box may hang at 71%or 88%. This issue is caused by the upload timing out before it completes. 
Status: Resolved in Response 4.6.
Workaround: Limit the number of images and objects in the assessment. Avoid importing from ExamView because this causes a large number of additional objects to be added to the assessment.

Issue: Text questions automatically attach "1G" to the end of submitted answers that are only two characters long when using Response PE. Issue confirmed in English and Chinese OS.
Status: Unresolved
Workaround: None

Windows Issues:
Issue: Exporting assessment results to CSV will display a file association error message.
Status: Unresolved. Fix pending.
Workaround: The CSV will state save and open. The message is just an annoyance.

Issue: .SOS files exported from Response Connector for Eduphoria fail to upload to Eduphoria site.
Status: Unresolved
Workaround: This issue is caused by a colon that the Response Connector adds to the title of the test. You can open the .SOS file in a text editor and delete the colon from the test name. This will allow the file to upload correctly.

Mac OS X Issues:
Issues: Notebook will launch if you attempt to to close the blue notification box that pops up from the Response Desktop menu instead of dismissing the pop-up.
Status: Status: Resolved in Response 4.6.
